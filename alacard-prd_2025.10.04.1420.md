# Alacard ‚Äî AI Manuals for AI Models
## Product Requirements Document (Full Vision)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** Vision Document

## üéØ Executive Summary

Alacard is the IKEA assembly layer for AI. We're solving the adoption crisis for 2.1M+ AI models on Hugging Face by making it trivially easy to try, learn, and deploy any model through interactive, runnable code notebooks.

**The Problem:** When a new AI model launches, teams spend hours wrestling with bad documentation, failed setup attempts, and "vibe checking" models manually. Most of the 2.1M models on Hugging Face never get used because people don't know how to use them. Arbitrary benchmarks don't tell you if a model is actually good for your use case.

**The Solution:** A card-based recipe builder that generates customized, educational Jupyter notebooks for any Hugging Face model. Mix Model Cards, Prompt Cards, Topic Cards, Difficulty Cards, and UI Component Cards to create the perfect learning experience. Share, remix, and improve notebooks with the community to strengthen the open source AI ecosystem.

**The Vision:** Every AI model has a thriving ecosystem of community-created notebooks that make it easy for anyone to try, learn, and deploy. No more wasted hours on setup. No more relying on a handful of major providers. "That was easy" becomes the default experience.

## üß† Problem Statement

### The AI Model Adoption Crisis

**2.1 million models exist on Hugging Face. Most never get used.**

Why?

1. **Bad/No Documentation**: New models launch with sparse READMEs, broken examples, or no examples at all
2. **High Friction Setup**: Enterprise teams try a model once, it fails, they move on‚Äîno debugging
3. **Vibe Checking at Scale**: Everyone manually tests models because benchmarks are arbitrary and don't reflect real use cases
4. **Time Expensive**: Even advanced users spend hours per model on setup, testing, and evaluation
5. **Hyper-Consolidation**: Teams default to 4-5 major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta) because it's easier, even when open source models would work better

### The Cost

- **For Developers**: Hours wasted per model attempt; opportunity cost of not finding better models
- **For Enterprises**: Over-speccing models (paying for GPT-4 when Llama 3.2 would work); vendor lock-in
- **For Open Source**: Talented developers create amazing models that die in obscurity due to poor onboarding
- **For Society**: Dangerous consolidation of AI capabilities in a handful of companies

## üë• Target Users

### Primary Personas

**1. The Pragmatic Engineer (Primary)**
- **Profile**: Mid-senior engineer at a startup/scale-up building AI features
- **Pain**: New model announced ‚Üí spends 2 hours trying to get it working ‚Üí gives up and uses OpenAI again
- **Goal**: Quickly evaluate if a new model works for their use case without wasting time
- **Success**: "I tried 3 models in 30 minutes and found one that's 10x cheaper than GPT-4"

**2. The AI Explorer (Secondary)**
- **Profile**: Data scientist, ML engineer, or advanced hobbyist who lives in model-land
- **Pain**: Even with expertise, every new model requires manual setup and testing
- **Goal**: Stay current with new models; build a personal library of working examples
- **Success**: "I have a collection of 50+ notebooks I've created and remixed that I reference constantly"

**3. The Learning Developer (Growth)**
- **Profile**: Junior/mid developer learning AI; wants to understand how models actually work
- **Pain**: Tutorials are either too basic (hello world) or too advanced (assumes PhD knowledge)
- **Goal**: Learn by doing with progressively complex examples
- **Success**: "I went from zero to deploying a custom chat UI in a weekend"

### Anti-Personas

- **Pure Researchers**: Need custom training pipelines, not pre-built notebooks
- **Non-Technical PMs**: Can't run Jupyter notebooks; need no-code tools
- **Enterprise ML Ops**: Need production deployment tools, not learning materials

## üé® Core Concept: Card-Based Recipe Building

### The Metaphor

Think of building with AI like cooking. You need:
- **Proteins** (Model Cards): The main ingredient
- **Seasonings** (Prompt Cards): How you interact with it
- **Theme** (Topic Cards): What domain/use case
- **Skill Level** (Difficulty Cards): Beginner to advanced
- **Presentation** (UI Component Cards): How you serve it

Mix these cards together to create a "recipe" that generates a customized notebook.

### The Five Card Types

#### 1. Model Cards ü¶ô
Browse and search 2.1M+ Hugging Face models as visual cards
- **Display**: Model name, emoji, category, downloads, parameters, license
- **Metadata**: Pipeline tag, task type, framework, model size
- **Curation**: Featured models, trending models, category filters
- **Search**: Fuzzy search by name, task, or description

#### 2. Prompt Card Packs üí¨
Themed sets of 3-5 prompts that define how you interact with the model
- **Quick Start**: Basic hello world examples
- **Real World**: Practical use cases (summarization, Q&A, classification)
- **Creative**: Fun, unexpected prompts (meme generation, story writing)
- **Domain-Specific**: Healthcare, legal, finance, education
- **Editable**: Users can modify prompts inline before generating

#### 3. Topic Cards üéØ
Theme the examples around a specific domain
- üçû Sourdough bread making
- üéÆ Game development
- üìä Data analysis
- üé® Creative writing
- üíº Business use cases
- üè• Healthcare
- ‚öñÔ∏è Legal
- üéì Education

**Why This Matters**: Generic "hello world" examples don't help you understand if a model works for YOUR use case. Topic cards make examples immediately relevant.

#### 4. Difficulty Cards üìö
Adjust complexity and explanation depth
- **üå± Beginner**: Lots of comments, step-by-step explanations, simple examples
- **üåø Intermediate**: Moderate complexity, assumes basic Python knowledge
- **üå≥ Advanced**: Complex examples, minimal hand-holding, production patterns

**Why This Matters**: The same model needs different tutorials for different skill levels. Stop writing for PhD researchers when most users are pragmatic engineers.

#### 5. UI Component Cards üñ•Ô∏è
Choose how to interact with the model
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational UI with message history
- **Text Completion**: Single input ‚Üí output
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time token streaming
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple inputs efficiently
- **API Endpoint**: FastAPI/Flask wrapper
- **Gradio Demo**: Interactive web UI
- **Streamlit App**: Full dashboard

**Why This Matters**: You're not just learning the model‚Äîyou're building something you can actually use.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### 1. Shuffle: Remove Analysis Paralysis

**The Problem**: Staring at 2.1M models is overwhelming. Where do you even start?

**The Solution**: "Deal me a hand" button that generates a random but sensible recipe combination.

**How It Works**:
- Pre-curated "good" combinations based on compatibility
- Weighted randomness (popular models appear more often)
- Ensures cards are compatible (e.g., chat UI + conversational model)
- Users can lock certain cards and shuffle the rest

**Why It Matters**: Removes decision fatigue. Gets users started in seconds. Discovery through serendipity.

### 2. Generate: Create Customized Notebooks

**The Problem**: Generic tutorials don't match your use case or skill level.

**The Solution**: Generate notebooks customized by your recipe cards.

**How It Works**:
1. User selects cards (or shuffles)
2. Recipe Bar shows current selection
3. Click "Generate Notebook"
4. Server fetches model README from Hugging Face
5. Extracts code examples and documentation
6. Customizes based on difficulty (comments, explanations)
7. Reframes examples around topic (sourdough ‚Üí model's task)
8. Adds UI component code (chat interface, API wrapper, etc.)
9. Returns downloadable `.ipynb` file

**Notebook Structure**:
```
1. Title: "Alacard | {model} - {topic} ({difficulty})"
2. Recipe Summary: Visual cards showing what was selected
3. Environment Setup: Installs based on UI component
4. Hello World: Minimal working example
5. Explained Examples: Tailored to difficulty level
6. Topic-Specific Examples: Customized to selected topic
7. UI Component: Full implementation (chat, API, etc.)
8. Next Steps: Links to remix, share, and fork
```

**Why It Matters**: One model ‚Üí infinite tutorials based on who's learning and what they're building.

### 3. Share: Community-Driven Improvement

**The Problem**: Everyone wastes time solving the same setup problems.

**The Solution**: Every notebook gets a shareable link. Others can view, download, and remix.

**How It Works**:
- Click "Share" ‚Üí get unique URL
- Share page shows recipe cards + download button
- Public gallery of shared notebooks
- Search and filter by model, topic, difficulty
- Track views and downloads

**Why It Matters**: Your 2 hours of setup saves 1000 other developers 2 hours each. Network effects.

### 4. Remix: Fork and Improve

**The Problem**: Existing tutorials are close but not quite right for your use case.

**The Solution**: Fork any shared notebook, modify the recipe, regenerate.

**How It Works**:
- Click "Remix" on any shared notebook
- Opens generator with pre-filled cards
- User swaps cards (e.g., change difficulty from beginner to advanced)
- Regenerates with new customization
- Tracks provenance (forked from X)
- Increments remix counter on original

**Why It Matters**: GitHub-style forking for AI tutorials. Community improvement loop.

### 5. Trending: Surface the Best

**The Problem**: How do you know which notebooks are actually good?

**The Solution**: Community curation through usage metrics.

**How It Works**:
- Track remix count, downloads, views
- "Trending" page shows most remixed notebooks
- Filter by model, topic, difficulty, recency
- "Official" badge for model creators who publish notebooks
- User ratings and comments (post-MVP)

**Why It Matters**: Crowdsourced quality. The best tutorials rise to the top.

## ‚ùì Open Questions & Risks

### Open Questions

1. **Customization Depth**: How much should users be able to edit before generating?
2. **Compute**: Should we offer cloud compute for running notebooks, or keep it local-only?
3. **Quality Control**: How do we ensure generated notebooks are high-quality?
4. **Model Coverage**: Do we support all 2.1M models, or curate a subset?
5. **Pricing**: Is $9/month the right price point?

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk: Generated notebooks don't work**
- Mitigation: Extensive testing, fallback templates, community feedback loop

**Risk: HF API rate limits**
- Mitigation: Cache model metadata, use webhooks for updates, paid HF API tier

**Risk: Low adoption (people don't care)**
- Mitigation: Validate with hackathon, iterate based on feedback, pivot if needed

**Risk: Quality varies wildly across models**
- Mitigation: Curated model list, community ratings, "verified" badges

**Risk: Legal issues with model licenses**
- Mitigation: Display licenses prominently, don't generate for restrictive licenses

**Risk: Competitors copy us**
- Mitigation: Move fast, build community moat, focus on quality

## üéì Success Stories (Envisioned)

### Story 1: The Pragmatic Engineer

"I'm building a customer support chatbot. I heard about Llama 3.2 but the docs were terrible. I used Alacard, shuffled until I got a chat UI recipe, and had a working prototype in 20 minutes. We ended up using it in production and saved $5K/month vs. OpenAI."

### Story 2: The Model Creator

"I spent months training a medical Q&A model, but nobody was using it. I partnered with Alacard to create official notebooks at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Downloads increased 10x and I got my first enterprise customer."

### Story 3: The Learning Developer

"I wanted to learn how LLMs work but every tutorial assumed I had a PhD. I found an Alacard notebook at the beginner level that explained everything step-by-step. I remixed it 5 times, each time increasing the difficulty. Now I'm building AI features at my job."

### Story 4: The Enterprise Team

"Our team was locked into OpenAI because nobody wanted to spend time evaluating alternatives. With Alacard, we evaluated 10 models in a day. We found 3 open source models that work better for our use cases and cut our AI costs by 60%."

### A. Notebook Generation Algorithm

```python
def generate_notebook(recipe):
    # 1. Fetch model data
    model_data = fetch_huggingface_model(recipe.model_card.hf_id)
    readme = fetch_readme(model_data.sha)
    
    # 2. Extract code examples
    code_blocks = extract_python_blocks(readme)
    if not code_blocks:
        code_blocks = generate_fallback_code(model_data.pipeline_tag)
    
    # 3. Customize based on recipe
    customized_cells = []
    
    # Title cell
    customized_cells.append(create_markdown_cell(
        f"# {recipe.model_card.name} - {recipe.topic.name} ({recipe.difficulty.level})"
    ))
    
    # Recipe summary cell
    customized_cells.append(create_recipe_summary_cell(recipe))
    
    # Environment setup
    installs = get_required_packages(recipe.ui_component)
    customized_cells.append(create_code_cell(
        f"!pip install {' '.join(installs)}"
    ))
    
    # Hello world (adjusted for difficulty)
    hello_code = customize_for_difficulty(
        code_blocks[0],
        recipe.difficulty.level
    )
    customized_cells.append(create_code_cell(hello_code))
    
    # Topic-specific examples
    for block in code_blocks[1:]:
        topic_code = reframe_for_topic(block, recipe.topic)
        customized_cells.append(create_code_cell(topic_code))
    
    # UI component implementation
    ui_code = generate_ui_component(
        recipe.ui_component,
        model_data,
        recipe.prompt_cards
    )
    customized_cells.append(create_code_cell(ui_code))
    
    # Next steps
    customized_cells.append(create_markdown_cell(
        f"## Next Steps\n\n"
        f"- [Remix this notebook]({get_share_url(recipe)})\n"
        f"- [Try a different difficulty level]\n"
        f"- [Explore similar models]"
    ))
    
    # 4. Create notebook JSON
    notebook = {
        "cells": customized_cells,
        "metadata": {
            "kernelspec": {"name": "python3"},
            "language_info": {"name": "python"}
        },
        "nbformat": 4,
        "nbformat_minor": 5
    }
    
    # 5. Save and return
    share_id = save_notebook(recipe, notebook)
    return share_id
```

### B. Shuffle Algorithm

```python
def shuffle_recipe(locked_cards=None):
    """Generate a random but sensible recipe combination"""
    
    # Start with locked cards
    recipe = locked_cards or {}
    
    # Select model (weighted by popularity)
    if 'model_card' not in recipe:
        recipe['model_card'] = weighted_random_model()
    
    # Select compatible prompt pack
    if 'prompt_cards' not in recipe:
        compatible_prompts = get_compatible_prompts(
            recipe['model_card'].pipeline_tag
        )
        recipe['prompt_cards'] = random.choice(compatible_prompts)
    
    # Select random topic
    if 'topic' not in recipe:
        recipe['topic'] = random.choice(TOPIC_CARDS)
    
    # Select difficulty (weighted toward beginner)
    if 'difficulty' not in recipe:
        recipe['difficulty'] = weighted_choice([
            (BEGINNER, 0.5),
            (INTERMEDIATE, 0.3),
            (ADVANCED, 0.2)
        ])
    
    # Select compatible UI component
    if 'ui_component' not in recipe:
        compatible_ui = get_compatible_ui_components(
            recipe['model_card'].pipeline_tag
        )
        recipe['ui_component'] = random.choice(compatible_ui)
    
    return recipe
```

### C. Remix Tracking

```sql
-- When a notebook is remixed
INSERT INTO notebooks (recipe, hf_model_id, notebook_content, metadata)
VALUES (
  $1,  -- modified recipe
  $2,  -- model id
  $3,  -- generated notebook
  jsonb_build_object(
    'forked_from', $4,  -- original share_id
    'generated_by', 'alacard',
    'generated_at', now()
  )
);

-- Increment remix count on original
UPDATE notebooks
SET remix_count = remix_count + 1
WHERE share_id = $4;

-- Track remix chain
WITH RECURSIVE remix_chain AS (
  -- Base case: the current notebook
  SELECT id, share_id, metadata->>'forked_from' as parent_id, 1 as depth
  FROM notebooks
  WHERE share_id = $1
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- Recursive case: follow the chain
  SELECT n.id, n.share_id, n.metadata->>'forked_from', rc.depth + 1
  FROM notebooks n
  JOIN remix_chain rc ON n.share_id = rc.parent_id
  WHERE rc.depth < 10  -- Prevent infinite loops
)
SELECT * FROM remix_chain;
```
