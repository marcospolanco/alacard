# Document Alignment: PRD, Tech Strategy, and Video Script

This document summarizes the alignment between the product vision (`alacard-prd_2025.10.04.1420.md`), the technical strategy (`alacard-tech.md`), and the promotional video script (`videoscript.md`).

---

## ‚úÖ Overall Conclusion: Strong Alignment

There is **excellent and consistent alignment** across all three documents. The video script serves as a perfect, concise summary of the product vision, and the technical strategy provides a clear and feasible blueprint for implementing that vision.

- The **PRD** defines the *What* and *Why*.
- The **Tech Strategy** defines the *How*.
- The **Video Script** effectively communicates the most compelling aspects of the *What, Why, and How* for a general audience.

## üìÑ `alacard-prd_2025.10.04.1420.md` (Product Vision) vs. Video Script

The PRD fully supports every concept mentioned in the video script. The script is a condensed version of the PRD's core message.

| Video Script Concept | PRD Alignment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Problem** | The PRD's "Problem Statement" section details the exact same issues: poor documentation, high friction setup, and over-reliance on a few major providers. |
| **Solution** | The PRD's "Core Concept: Card-Based Recipe Building" section provides a deep dive into the five card types (Model, Prompt, Topic, Difficulty, UI) mentioned in the script. |
| **Key Differentiators** | The PRD dedicates entire sections to the core features of **Shuffle**, **Generate**, **Share**, **Remix**, and **Trending**, which directly map to the differentiators listed in the script. |
| **Ideal Demo Flow** | The 3-step demo flow (Shuffle ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Share/Remix) is a direct walkthrough of the primary user flow outlined in the PRD's "User Experience" section. |
| **MVP Architecture** | The PRD's "High-Level Stack" (Next.js, Supabase, HF API) perfectly matches the MVP architecture described in the script. |

## üõ†Ô∏è `alacard-tech.md` (Technical Strategy) vs. Video Script

The technical strategy document provides the specific implementation plan required to build the product shown in the video script.

| Video Script Concept | Technical Strategy Alignment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Card-Based Builder** | The tech doc defines the database schema (`card_presets` table) and API endpoints (`/api/cards/:type`, `/api/shuffle`) needed to power the card system. |
| **Notebook Generation** | The "Notebook Generation Pipeline" section details the technical steps of fetching data from the Hugging Face API and assembling the `.ipynb` file, as mentioned in the script. |
| **Share & Remix** | The database schema includes `remix_count` and `view_count` fields, and the API specification includes endpoints like `/api/notebook/:shareId/remix` and `/api/trending` to enable the community features. |
| **Architecture** | The tech doc confirms the use of Next.js, Supabase, and Hugging Face API integrations, aligning perfectly with the script's MVP architecture summary. |
| **Demo Flow Support** | The API endpoints specified in the tech doc (e.g., `/api/shuffle`, `/api/notebook/generate`, `/api/notebook/:shareId/remix`) are the exact backend services required to execute the 3-step demo flow from the video script. |

## üéØ Final Verdict

The product vision, technical strategy, and video script are in perfect sync. They tell a consistent and compelling story from high-level concept down to the technical implementation details.
