# Alacard — AI Manuals for AI Models

## Judge‑Ready One Pager

### Executive Summary

Alacard turns any Hugging Face model into a runnable, teachable notebook that matches your use case and skill level. Users compose a recipe from five card types. Alacard then generates a clean Jupyter notebook that fetches model docs, adds topic‑specific examples, injects a chosen UI, and verifies imports. The result is a consistent first‑run success experience that reduces evaluation time from hours to minutes and drives real adoption across the long tail of models.

### Problem

•⁠  ⁠New models ship with sparse or inconsistent docs. Teams waste hours and give up.
•⁠  ⁠Benchmarks do not answer the question that matters: will this work for my task at my cost target.
•⁠  ⁠The ecosystem over relies on a few providers because trying open models is painful.

### Solution

A card‑based recipe builder that outputs a customized, runnable .ipynb:

•⁠  ⁠*Model Card*: any HF model the user selects or shuffles
•⁠  ⁠*Prompt Pack*: quick start, real world, creative, or domain sets
•⁠  ⁠*Topic*: aligns examples with a domain like healthcare or data analysis
•⁠  ⁠*Difficulty*: beginner, intermediate, or advanced
•⁠  ⁠*UI Component*: chat, API endpoint, Gradio, Streamlit, or batch

### Why Now

Model count and release velocity keep rising while documentation quality lags. Teams need faster evaluations and cheaper alternatives that still meet quality requirements.

### Differentiators

•⁠  ⁠*Customized notebooks* by topic and difficulty
•⁠  ⁠*Remix and provenance* that track forks across the community
•⁠  ⁠*Trending and search* that surface the most useful notebooks
•⁠  ⁠*Vendor coverage* across the HF ecosystem rather than a single model family

### Ideal Demo (3 steps)

1.⁠ ⁠Click Shuffle to get a sensible recipe. 2) Click Generate to receive a notebook that runs on first try. 3) Share link and click Remix to change difficulty or UI. Judges see a working chat UI in the notebook plus a public share page that shows metrics.

### Architecture (MVP)

•⁠  ⁠*Frontend*: Next.js App Router, Tailwind, minimal card UI
•⁠  ⁠*Backend*: Next.js API routes on Vercel
•⁠  ⁠*Data*: Supabase Postgres for notebooks and metrics, Storage for .ipynb
•⁠  ⁠*Integrations*: HF Inference and Model APIs, optional LLM for templating
