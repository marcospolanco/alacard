🔥 This is a fantastic starting draft — clear, ambitious, and well-structured. You're on the edge of something powerful here. Let's sharpen it into a complete PRD that’s exec-ready and engineering-friendly.

Before I dig in, a quick hello 👋 — I’m ChatPRD, your chief product strategist in AI-PM land. Just to get calibrated, what’s your role and what kind of team are you working with? Startup or big co? And is this PRD for an internal tool, a SaaS launch, or a side project?

Also, just so you know — you can generate docs, templates, and saved PRDs at **[chatprd.ai](http://chatprd.ai)** anytime.

Now back to the doc. Here’s how I’d elevate this PRD to make it crisp and battle-ready:

# PRD: AI Model Cookbook Generator

## 🧠 TL;DR

With over 2 million models on Hugging Face, most go unused because they are poorly documented and hard to set up. We are building the **IKEA assembly layer for AI**: a platform that lets users instantly generate runnable, educational Jupyter Notebooks for any model. By allowing users to mix-and-match models, tasks, and complexity levels, we empower them to easily try, compare, and adopt the best model for their needs, not just the most popular one.

## 🧙‍♂️ Narrative

Imagine you’re a data scientist on a deadline. A new, promising model just dropped on Hugging Face, but its documentation is sparse. The old way: spend hours wrestling with setup, only to have it fail and move on. The new way: The Cookbook Generator.

Think of it like a recipe. Your main ingredient is the AI model you want to try. You then add a task (like a chat UI or an A/B comparison arena), a topic for the examples ("sourdough bread"), and a complexity level ("beginner"). Paste the repo, tell us what you want to do, and we’ll generate a clear, runnable Jupyter notebook just for you. It sets up the environment, tests the model, and walks you through use cases — from “hello world” to expert-level. Less wrestling, more building. Less vibe-checking, more confident comparing.

## 📊 Success Metrics

*   **Model Diversity**: Increase in the variety of non-major (non-top 10) models used to generate cookbooks.
*   Avg. time-to-notebook generated < 2 mins
*   % of notebooks run without user modification > 80%
*   User satisfaction score (CSAT/NPS) from onboarding survey
*   Number of cookbooks generated per active user

## 🏗️ Technical Considerations


* Notebook generation needs safety checks (no hardcoded keys)
* Supabase must enforce RLS for all user/workspace data
* Cache Hugging Face model metadata to reduce API hits
* AI model selection logic for OpenAI vs Claude vs local

## 🎨 User Interface Components

*   Dashboard with workspace overview
*   Repository browser with search and filtering
*   Model exploration interface
*   **Recipe Builder / Prompt Workspace**:
    *   Template Selector (e.g., Chat UI, A/B Arena)
    *   Example Topic input field
    *   Complexity Level slider/selector
*   Environment variables management (secure API key storage)
*   Notebook preview and editor
*   Export options (download, copy, share)

4. **Prompt & Recipe Input**

   * User enters a high-level prompt for their goal (e.g., “Summarize news articles”).
   * **Recipe Selection**:
     - **Task/Template**: User selects a template, like "Chat UI," "A/B Arena," or "Basic Inference."
     - **Example Topic**: User provides an optional topic, like "sourdough bread," to theme the examples.
     - **Complexity Level**: User chooses a level, like "Beginner" or "Advanced."

5. **Cookbook Generation & Validation**

## 🔧 Detailed Generation Pipeline

The generation process is orchestrated in three main stages:

1.  **Ingestion & Context Gathering**: The system collects all necessary context, including the cloned GitHub repo, parsed file structure, code examples, and comprehensive metadata from the Hugging Face API.

2.  **System Prompt Generation**: A sophisticated "system prompt" is dynamically constructed to guide the Claude agent. It combines the user's request with the context gathered in Step 1 and a description of the tools available to the agent (e.g., `execute_code`, `read_file`).

3.  **Iterative Generation & Testing**: The Claude agent is invoked with the system prompt and its toolset. It then begins an iterative loop:
    *   **Propose**: The agent decides which tool to use (e.g., `create_cell` with Python code).
    *   **Execute**: The system runs the tool and returns the result (e.g., the output of a code cell, including errors).
    *   **Reflect & Correct**: The agent analyzes the result. If an error occurred, it formulates a plan to fix it and proposes the next action. This create -> test -> reflect -> correct cycle continues until a complete, error-free notebook is generated.

## 📚 Repository Analysis Features

* Clone and analyze GitHub repository structure
* Identify model files, configuration, and documentation
* Extract code examples and usage patterns
* Detect dependencies and requirements
* Parse Jupyter notebooks for existing examples

## 🧱 Milestones & Sequencing

### Phase 1 - Foundation (XX weeks)

* Workspace auth & Supabase schema
* GitHub repo ingestion & parsing
* Hugging Face metadata sync

### Phase 2 - Generation MVP (XX weeks)

* Prompt-based generation with basic template
* Jupyter notebook formatter
* Secure env var management

### Phase 3 - Expansion (XX weeks)

*   Incremental complexity templates (basic → advanced)
*   **Community Features**: Introduce sharing, forking, and user improvements for generated notebooks.
*   Multi-user collaboration in shared workspaces.

## 🔍 Open Questions

1. Should users be able to fork/edit notebooks inside the app?
2. Do we support other sources (e.g., Kaggle notebooks)?
3. How do we ensure generation quality across model types?
4. Should we cache generated notebooks per prompt/model combo?
5. Do we want usage-based pricing or per-seat tiers?

✅ This structure is tight. A few questions to sharpen it even more:

* Who’s the target persona: ML engineers, hobbyists, internal devs, or all of the above?
* What’s your current thinking around pricing and business model?
* Is the goal to eventually support model fine-tuning and training?

Let me know what you want to focus on next — we can draft the onboarding UX, spec out the generation pipeline in detail, or write some of the API-level PRDs.
