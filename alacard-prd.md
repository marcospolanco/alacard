Before I dig in, a quick hello 👋 — I’m ChatPRD, your chief product strategist in AI-PM land. Just to get calibrated, what’s your role and what kind of team are you working with? Startup or big co? And is this PRD for an internal tool, a SaaS launch, or a side project?

Also, just so you know — you can generate docs, templates, and saved PRDs at **[chatprd.ai](http://chatprd.ai)** anytime.

Now back to the doc. Here’s how I’d elevate this PRD to make it crisp and battle-ready:

# PRD: AI Model Cookbook Generator

## 🧠 TL;DR

We’re building a platform that ingests GitHub repositories tied to Hugging Face models, extracts useful metadata and code patterns, and turns that into user-customized, AI-generated Jupyter notebook “cookbooks.” These cookbooks guide users from environment setup to advanced usage, tailored to their specific prompt or task.

## 🧭 Goals

### 🎯 Business Goals

* Reduce time-to-value for ML engineers and researchers using open-source models
* Increase adoption of Hugging Face models by improving usability
* Unlock monetization via usage-based pricing or workspace tiers

### 👩‍💻 User Goals

* Quickly understand how to use a model with relevant examples
* Get runnable code tailored to their problem without reading full repos or docs
* Safely manage secrets and environment setup

### 🚫 Non-Goals

*   We will not support model training or fine-tuning pipelines (in V1).
*   The service does not provide a user-facing notebook execution environment like Google Colab. While the AI agent uses a sandboxed backend environment to *validate* the notebook, users cannot run or edit notebooks within the application.

## 🧍 User Stories

1. *“I found a cool model on Hugging Face but don’t know how to use it.”*
2. *“I want to generate a working notebook that sets up, tests, and demonstrates the model with my data.”*
3. *“I need to securely store my API keys and download the generated code.”*

## 🧩 User Experience Flow

1. **Sign Up + Workspace Creation**

   * User signs up with email/password or OAuth
   * Creates a named workspace

2. **Model Discovery or Repo Ingestion**

   * Option 1: Paste GitHub repo URL tied to a HF model
   * Option 2: Search and browse Hugging Face models via integrated API

3. **System Ingests Model**

   * Parses repo structure and content
   * Extracts examples, metadata, and config files
   * Links to Hugging Face model ID
   * Fetches comprehensive model metadata:
     - Model info: modelId, author, sha, createdAt, lastModified, downloads, likes, tags
     - Model card data: description, usage, limitations, license, citation
     - Pipeline information: supported tasks, input/output formats
     - File structure: model files, configuration files, examples
     - Community metrics: downloads, likes, discussion activity

4. **Prompt Input**

   * User enters what they’re trying to do (“Summarize news articles”)
   * Optional: upload sample data or choose task type

5. **Cookbook Generation & Validation**

   * The system invokes a specialized Claude AI agent designed to act like a developer relations engineer.
   * The agent is given a clear goal (based on the user's prompt) and a set of tools to write, test, and debug code within a sandboxed Jupyter environment.
   * **Iterative Build-Test-Debug Loop**: The agent doesn't just write code; it validates it. It will write a block of code for installation, execute it, and check for errors. If an error occurs, it will attempt to fix it. This cycle repeats for setup, basic usage, and advanced examples, ensuring the final notebook is runnable out-of-the-box.
   * The process covers environment setup, dependency installation, model instantiation, and a progression from basic to advanced usage, all tailored to the user's prompt.

6. **Review + Download**

   * User can preview the validated, runnable notebook.
   * Download .ipynb or copy to clipboard.

## 🧙‍♂️ Narrative

Imagine you’re a data scientist on a deadline. You found a Hugging Face model that looks promising — but it’s just a bunch of files and a README. You need to see it work, fast.

Enter the Cookbook Generator. Paste the repo or pick a model, tell us what you want to do, and we’ll generate a clear, runnable Jupyter notebook just for you. It sets up the environment, tests the model, and walks you through use cases — from “hello world” to expert-level. Less Googling, more building.

## 📊 Success Metrics

* Avg. time-to-notebook generated < 2 mins
* % of notebooks run without user modification > 80%
* User satisfaction score (CSAT/NPS) from onboarding survey
* Number of cookbooks generated per active user
* Hugging Face model coverage (most-used models supported)

## 🏗️ Technical Considerations

* Repo ingestion must support private GitHub auth (OAuth + PAT)
* Notebook generation needs safety checks (no hardcoded keys)
* Supabase must enforce RLS for all user/workspace data
* Cache Hugging Face model metadata to reduce API hits
* AI model selection logic for OpenAI vs Claude vs local

## 🎨 User Interface Components

* Dashboard with workspace overview
* Repository browser with search and filtering
* Model exploration interface
* Prompt engineering workspace
* Environment variables management (secure API key storage)
* Model validation and testing interface
* Step-by-step guidance with incremental complexity
* Notebook preview and editor
* Export options (download, copy, share)

## 🔧 Detailed Generation Pipeline

The generation process is orchestrated in three main stages:

1.  **Ingestion & Context Gathering**: The system collects all necessary context, including the cloned GitHub repo, parsed file structure, code examples, and comprehensive metadata from the Hugging Face API.

2.  **System Prompt Generation**: A sophisticated "system prompt" is dynamically constructed to guide the Claude agent. It combines the user's request with the context gathered in Step 1 and a description of the tools available to the agent (e.g., `execute_code`, `read_file`).

3.  **Iterative Generation & Testing**: The Claude agent is invoked with the system prompt and its toolset. It then begins an iterative loop:
    *   **Propose**: The agent decides which tool to use (e.g., `create_cell` with Python code).
    *   **Execute**: The system runs the tool and returns the result (e.g., the output of a code cell, including errors).
    *   **Reflect & Correct**: The agent analyzes the result. If an error occurred, it formulates a plan to fix it and proposes the next action. This create -> test -> reflect -> correct cycle continues until a complete, error-free notebook is generated.

## 📚 Repository Analysis Features

* Clone and analyze GitHub repository structure
* Identify model files, configuration, and documentation
* Extract code examples and usage patterns
* Detect dependencies and requirements
* Parse Jupyter notebooks for existing examples

## 🧱 Milestones & Sequencing

### Phase 1 - Foundation (XX weeks)

* Workspace auth & Supabase schema
* GitHub repo ingestion & parsing
* Hugging Face metadata sync

### Phase 2 - Generation MVP (XX weeks)

* Prompt-based generation with basic template
* Jupyter notebook formatter
* Secure env var management

### Phase 3 - Expansion (XX weeks)

* Incremental complexity templates (basic → advanced)
* Notebook preview + versioning
* Multi-user collaboration in shared workspaces

## 🔍 Open Questions

1. Should users be able to fork/edit notebooks inside the app?
2. Do we support other sources (e.g., Kaggle notebooks)?
3. How do we ensure generation quality across model types?
4. Should we cache generated notebooks per prompt/model combo?
5. Do we want usage-based pricing or per-seat tiers?

✅ This structure is tight. A few questions to sharpen it even more:

* Who’s the target persona: ML engineers, hobbyists, internal devs, or all of the above?
* What’s your current thinking around pricing and business model?
* Is the goal to eventually support model fine-tuning and training?

Let me know what you want to focus on next — we can draft the onboarding UX, spec out the generation pipeline in detail, or write some of the API-level PRDs.
